# Tips
1. to store passwords you need to install sshpass that allows to offer a password via SSH

    to install it with brew use
    ```
    brew install http://git.io/sshpass.rb
    ```
    for other options see: [https://github.com/kevinburke/sshpass](https://github.com/kevinburke/sshpass)

2. To see all available ssh options run ``man ssh_config``

# Make local 
```
find . -name "*.go" | xargs sed -i 's|github.com/trntv/sshed|..|g'
make
# GO BACK
find . -name "*.go" | xargs grep -nP "\x22\.\./[a-z]+\x22" | awk '{split($1, arr, ":");system("sed -i \'"arr[2]"s|../|github.com/trntv/sshed/|g\' "arr[1])}'
```
